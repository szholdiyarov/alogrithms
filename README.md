# Alogrithms solutions

This project contains my solutions to some random coding challenges I found on the web.

Some of the classes are replicated on both [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/) and [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/). But I prefer the second one, so all of the solutions are only on Kotlin.

** Please do contribute ** if you feel that something could be improved or refactored.
I am really looking to include more test cases, but my fantasy is not always good.

## Solved problems (or structure):

1. solutions/arrays
2. solutions/binary_search
3. solutions/cakes - This package contains solutions to exercises from [Interview Cake](https://www.interviewcake.com).
4. solutions/random_questions - When I am not sure where to add the solution. Check this out to see some random questions and answers
5. solutions/sorting 
7. solutions/stacks_and_queues
8. solutions/stacks_and_queues_kt
9. solutions/string_expression
